## About
This project was created over the course of Northeastern University's Summer 2024 Dialouge of Civilizations to Leuven, Belgium focused on the intersection of software development and AI in the context of international policy and regulation. Targeted at understanding the relationships between various news sources and their influences on global sentiments, this app highlights how different users may be able to analyze countries of interests. They can predict sentiment scores of articles written about areas of interest, track articles, and more.

## Uses
When opening the app, the user can enter as three different personas.
